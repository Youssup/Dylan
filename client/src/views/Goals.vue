        <p class="text-white">I know how hard life can be. I know how hard it can be to look in the mirror and be happy with
            what you see. I know that there are people out, maybe even reading this, that feel tired, ugly, not
            appreciated and maybe even down right useless. It's my mission and my promise to you reading
            this that every single piece of content I put out will be directed towards making as many people's
            days as I can. I want to make the world a better and happier place and I will continue to do so
            under any given circumstance. I love editing, creating, posting, and working on social media
            stuff so being able to do that while making a difference is awesome. My purpose in life is to
            make people smile and if I have accomplished that with you, the person reading, just once then
            I am a very happy dylan.</p>
